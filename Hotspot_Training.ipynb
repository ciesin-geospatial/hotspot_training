For example, the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/understanding-poverty#:~:text=Regions%20are%20categorized%20using%20PIP%20definition.&text=Note%20on%20global%20poverty%20lines,%242.15%20per%20person%20per%20day.\" target=\"_blank\">World Bank defined the global extreme-poverty line as $2.15 USD (2022)</a> income or below per day, which is based on the national poverty lines of the world’s 15 poorest countries. However, these indicators do not entirely consider other non-financial forms of poverty that may be of equal importance. The concept of multidimensional poverty encompasses a more holistic view because it attempts to account for the lived experiences of people and the multiple deprivations they face in their daily lives beyond their incomes.\n",
